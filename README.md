**GEOG 458: Final Essay**

**GitHub repository:** https://github.com/covid19india

## Introduction

This dashboard is a crowdsource prohect that aims to track the spread of nCOVID-19 in India and the extent of the outbreak in the country. The dhome page primarily shows the spread of cases in India as a choropleth with a table that lists the number of cases by state and district.

I chose to analyze this dashboard for a couple of reasons. First, it is completely volunteer driven and open source, which means that this is a community response to the disease and shows how dashboards and mapping can help the community directly. Secondly, I really like how well-maintained and active it is. Given, the disease is new and widely spreading. A dev community response like this ensures that the ensures that the webapp evolves as the need evolves. Although, the project started as a dashboard only to track the disease, it now also lists places where people can buy essential commodities.
