**GEOG 458: Final Essay**

**GitHub repository:** https://github.com/covid19india

## Introduction

This dashboard is a crowdsource prohect that aims to track the spread of nCOVID-19 in India and the extent of the outbreak in the country. The dhome page primarily shows the spread of cases in India as a choropleth with a table that lists the number of cases by state and district.

I chose to analyze this dashboard for a couple of reasons. First, it is completely volunteer driven and open source, which means that this is a community response to the disease and shows how dashboards and mapping can help the community directly. Secondly, I really like how well-maintained and active it is. Given, the disease is new and widely spreading. A dev community response like this ensures that the ensures that the webapp evolves as the need evolves. Although, the project started as a dashboard only to track the disease, it now also lists places where people can buy essential commodities.

The dashboard is created and maintained by "a group of dedicated volunteers". The primary function of the webapp is in **Home** tab, it is to show the spread of the cases and also to keep a track of the spread of the disease by mapping the spread between patients in the **Demographics** tab. Apart from that there is a **Essentials** tab that shows users where they can find essentials based on their current location.

The target audience for the app is the general population in India and policymakers if they choose to use the website to get their statistics. The app works well for the target audience as it has everything related to the disease and the resources they might need.
